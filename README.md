## Project Summaries
1. OmniPower – Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression

	This project predicts sales values based on features such as Price and Promotion.
	
	Includes: <br>
	Data cleaning and preprocessing
	
	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	
	Feature selection
	
	Train–test split
	
	Linear Regression model
	
	Evaluation using R² score and error metrics
	
	Visualisation of predictions vs actual values
	
	Goal: <br>
	Understand the relationship between price, promotions, and sales, and build a simple regression model to assist business forecasting.

2. Boston Housing – Predicting House Prices

	A classic regression problem predicting median house value based on multiple housing features.
	
	Includes:
	
	Feature correlations and heatmaps
	
	Selection of key features
	
	Training a linear regression model
	
	Evaluating performance using R²
	
	Scatter plots comparing predictions and actual values

	Goal:
	Identify how important housing attributes influence pricing and build a baseline predictive model.
