# OmniPower – Linear Regression Sales Prediction

This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict sales using the OmniPower dataset. It demonstrates the full workflow of preparing data, selecting features, training a model, and evaluating performance.

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to understand how factors such as Price and Promotion influence sales, and to build a predictive model that can help support business decision-making.

## This project includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection (Price, Promotion)

Train–test split

Building a Linear Regression model

Model evaluation using R² and error metrics

Visualisations of predictions vs actual sales

## 📁 Files Included
