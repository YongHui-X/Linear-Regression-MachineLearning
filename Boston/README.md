1. Project Overview
The goal of this project was to apply Linear Regression to the Boston Housing Dataset to predict MEDV (Median value of owner-occupied homes). <br>
The model learns a linear relationship between the housing feature and the target price. <br>

2. Dataset Description
The dataset is split into: <br>
  -80% training data <br>
  -20% test data <br>

3. Skills
This project demonstrates: <br>
  -How to build a simple linear regression model in scikit-learn  <br>
  -How to train, evaluate, and interpret the model <br>
  -How to manually compute predictions <br>
  -How to visualise actual vs predicted values <br>
  -Clean code suitable for machine learning <br>
